This game uses the Phenomenon Game Engine, found at https://github.com/Limvot/Phenomenon-Engine
The engine and game both use SDL, and the engine uses GLEW, so these should be installed on your system.
You will have to modify the Code::Blocks project to correspond to the directories where you have the different headers and libraries, including those for Phenomenon.

Right now, due to its small size, the Phenomenon engine is statically linked.
